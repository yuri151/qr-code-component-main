## Overview
hello this is my first Frontend Mentor project and it's a card with a qr code I've been studying HTML and CSS for about a month.

## My process
I started looking at the design to understand what had to be ugly after doing that I went to see the style-guide and the html.

I started to make the html with all the necessary elements for the project as soon as the html was structured I went to the style leaving things beautiful I called the main selectors of the project as: font-family font-size and I imported the font inside others then I centralized the elements and organized the proportion of the div box and elements as the img I finished adding the colors.

average time to complete the project was: 1h 30

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
I am proud of this part of the code because I was having a lot of difficulty centering the elements because I was using the flexbox of the body and it was not working so I understood that in a div it worked normally and I arrived at this solution

CSS

### Continued development

what I want to continue learning and testing would be the display: flex

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - this helped to align the page elements.
